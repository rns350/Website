        <h1 lang="en-us">What is Reed's Quest?</h1>
        <p lang="en-us"> Quite simply, my goal here is to find something meaningful in my life.
            Sometimes I feel I have so much potential but nothing to show for it,
            even after graduating cum laude with a 4 year degree from New York
            University.  Companies seem to agree with this considering that I've applied
            to over 60 jobs and have yet to recieve a single interview.  If I can't prove
            myself, then I cannot move foward.  My first priority is to get a job and
            to a save up some money.  I hope to make my first 100k within five years, and
            then from there, I hope to leave my mark on this world.  Feel free to follow
            me along.
        </p>
        <p lang="en-us"> The first goal, of course, is going to be to learn html and css.  That's a given.
            As a teaching tool, I am using the book <cite>HTML&CSS: design and build websites</cite>
            by Jon Duckett.  So far it seems to work nicely, which is evident by the fact that 
            the page you are currently looking at even exists in the first place.  To be honest, I was daunted
            by just how <em>long</em> this book is, as I wasn't expecting HTML and CSS to suck up a lot
            of my time in the first place.  Turns out it is full of pictures and very little writing
            per page, so its actually a great resource that I would recommend.  I heard about the book
            from my beautiful girlfriend Tina, who is a great google programmer herself, as she 
            used it to learn the languages as well.  Needless to say, it worked for her.
        </p>
        <p lang="en-us"> I don't want for this first goal to take more than a week, and I am going to be constantly
            updating this website and holding myself accountable.  From there, I hope to learn javascript
            as my next task.  Until then, expect many changes to come to this site.  With all of that said,
            I officially declare my first mission on this quest.
