          <h2>What is Bonfire Side?</h2>
          <p>
            Bonfire Side is many things; it is a personal blog, project hub, and creative writing repository.
            My goal in creating this website is to have a personal place to practice and hone my web development skills.
            To get myself motivated, I'm hoping to eventually grow this small site into a showcase of my
            work and acomplishments.  This achieves a two-fold purpose.  Firstly, having this website provides an incentive for
            me to expand my resume of work, as a good website needs content.  Secondly, my excitement to grow the website
            will produce an impetus to create new work.  It's quite the symbiotic relationship.</p>
          <p>
            Today, the website is still small, and all of the sections have not yet been completed.  That being said,
            I feel incredibly driven to share my experience with the world.  I hope that You will stick around,
            and find some enjoyment as I begin to write blog posts and post some of my writing.  Cherish the simplicity
            of this site today; within a few months time, I hope to make this place much much more.</p>

                <p lang="en-us"> Quite simply, my goal here is to find something meaningful in my life.
                    Sometimes I feel I have so much potential but nothing to show for it,
                    even after graduating cum laude with a 4 year degree from New York
                    University.  Companies seem to agree with this considering that I've applied
                    to over 60 jobs and have yet to recieve a single interview.  If I can't prove
                    myself, then I cannot move foward.  My first priority is to get a job and
                    to a save up some money.  I hope to make my first 100k within five years, and
                    then from there, I hope to leave my mark on this world.  Feel free to follow
                    me along.
                </p>
                <p lang="en-us"> The first goal, of course, is going to be to learn html and css.  That's a given.
                    As a teaching tool, I am using the book <cite>HTML&CSS: design and build websites</cite>
                    by Jon Duckett.  So far it seems to work nicely, which is evident by the fact that 
                    the page you are currently looking at even exists in the first place.  To be honest, I was daunted
                    by just how <em>long</em> this book is, as I wasn't expecting HTML and CSS to suck up a lot
                    of my time in the first place.  Turns out it is full of pictures and very little writing
                    per page, so its actually a great resource that I would recommend.  I heard about the book
                    from my beautiful girlfriend Tina, who is a great google programmer herself, as she 
                    used it to learn the languages as well.  Needless to say, it worked for her.
                </p>
                <p lang="en-us"> I don't want for this first goal to take more than a week, and I am going to be constantly
                    updating this website and holding myself accountable.  From there, I hope to learn javascript
                    as my next task.  Until then, expect many changes to come to this site.  With all of that said,
                    I officially declare my first mission on this quest.
